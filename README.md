# Full-Stack Homework – Kohl's Black Friday Page

This project is a simple static recreation of a Kohl's Black Friday landing page for homework/practice purposes.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (external stylesheet)
- No JavaScript required

## Project Structure

- `Kohls.html` – main HTML page
- `Kohls.css` – styles for the page
- `images/`
  - `kohls-logo.png` – Kohl's logo used in the header

## Running the Page Locally

From the project root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open in your browser:

```text
http://localhost:8000/Kohls.html
```

To stop the server, return to the terminal window and press `Ctrl + C`.

## Notes

- Styles were refactored from an inline `<style>` block into `Kohls.css`.
- The layout and colors are loosely based on the Kohl's Black Friday page screenshot provided for the assignment.
